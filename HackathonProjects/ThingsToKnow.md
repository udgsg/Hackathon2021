### As a participant you will have the following options :

1. Come up with a simple idea related to any of the tracks mentioned here and show how you plan on solving it. Note, coding is not mandatory. You can present statistical conclusions for a given problem as deliverable too.

2. Solve one of the suggested problems either by yourself or by teaming up with others. We have uploaded some projects in GitHub and are still working on adding project ideas. Note, judges don't expect you to finish the entire problem since they understand the constraint of limited time. They would be looking into creative ideas (if you came up with your project idea), your approach towards solving a problem, presentation to a diverse audience (our judges are from diverse backgrounds i.e. both academy and industry as you can see here) etc.

3. You can also look at the proposed projects and use that as a motivation to come up with a similar idea of your own and present to our judges how you plan on solving it.

4. If you like an idea proposed by someone other than the organizers, you can ask them if you can join their team and offer how you can help them.
