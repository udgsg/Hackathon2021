## Proposer: Arshiya Khan (arshiyak@udel.edu)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Threat intelligence is information collected on attacks done by malicious actors/ hackers to compromise a service. It is determined by a metrics called indicators of compromise (IoC). It is important for any organization to keep track of IoCs reported by other bodies of interest and protect themselves from being compromised.

Among numerous threat intelligence articles published every day, summary and relevant information is collected.

## DELIVERABLE: 

A utility which takes input (text) and generates its summary and relevant keywords by using Transformer based deep learning models.

## SKILLS NEEDED:
