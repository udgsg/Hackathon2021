## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
In the USA, there have been more than 30 million cases of COVID-19 with almost 600 thousand of death. On the other hand, the number China reported is about 90 thousand cases with less than 5 thousand of death, which are about 0.3% and 1% compared to that of the USA. Remember, China is a country with more than 1.4 billion people and about 100 cities have more than 1 million population. These make it especially difficult to control pandemic in China. What made the difference? Does it reflect the success of China in fight COVID-19?

## DELIVERABLE:

    • strategies adopted at different stages

    • the work in testing and the standard for a case to be positive

    • the actions took towards positive cases

    • the statistics of the fatality
