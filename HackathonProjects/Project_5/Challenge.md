## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Do mask mandates actually reduce prevalence rates of COVID-19, or do they have minimal effects on transmission ability?

## DELIVERABLE: 
Goal: Use statistics to attempt to quantify any correlation between mask mandates and prevelance rates.

Step 1: Import data of reported COVID cases for two states to start: NJ and FL

Step 2: Include important dates: mask mandates, phased openings, etc.

Step 3: Search for any trends with COVID cases and population of individual counties in that state. (Do trends scale with population density?)

Step 4: For states with removed mask mandates, did the trends change? Could any prior trends found in the previous steps help to predict any new trend in this step?

Step 5: Expand the analysis for more states after the code works well and the analysis strategy is further refined.

## SKILLS NEEDED: 
Coding: Python for data science (pandas, numpy, etc.)
Statistics
Understanding policies of various states and any possible nuances in their mandates

## DATA: 
Covid data per U.S. state and territory: https://covidtracking.com/data/download
Further refine by county: https://covid.cdc.gov/
